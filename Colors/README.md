I like when source code is highlighted thoroughly. So here is my personal taste about it.
Along with settings file there is a page to look for a new colors.
If you want to try it, just go **'Tools' -> 'Import and Export Settings'** wizard and import `VisualStudioSettings_Colors.vssettings`.
Make sure you have checked **'Resharper' -> 'Options' -> 'Code Inspection' -> 'Settings' -> 'Color identifiers'**.
All your colors can be modified here: **'Tools' -> 'Options' -> 'Environment'  -> 'Fonts and Colors'**.
